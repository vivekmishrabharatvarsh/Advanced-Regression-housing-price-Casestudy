## Project Description

### Background
Surprise Housing aims to enter the Australian housing market and leverage data analytics to buy properties below market value and sell them at a higher price. The project involves building a regression model using regularization to predict the actual value of prospective properties.

### Business Problem
The company needs insights into significant variables influencing house prices and how well these variables describe the price of a house. The dataset used contains various features related to house properties.

### Model Performance and Recommendations
- Analysis of the model's predictive performance (R2 scores, RMSE) and comparison between Ridge and Lasso Regression models.
- Recommendations for Surprise Housing based on impactful features affecting house prices.
